# Credit Card Fraud Detection System

## Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. It employs models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to classify transactions as legitimate or suspicious, helping to reduce financial losses and enhance security.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Multiple classification models for fraud detection
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Interactive web interface (if applicable) for transaction input and fraud prediction

## Installation
